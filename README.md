# Ruby Method Arguments

## Learning Goals

- Describe the functionality of arguments
- Define a method that accepts arguments
- Recognize the difference between arguments and parameters
- Define a method that uses default arguments

## Introduction

In the real world, many of our interactions have a "template" behavior that is
applied to every interaction, but these behaviors change only slightly depending
on a tiny factor.

For example, the barista at the coffee shop will call out **your** name when
your order is ready. At the doctor's office, they may call **your** name when
it's your turn to see the doctor. The same process is followed for others who
buy coffee or go to the doctor, but, of course, the name will change depending
on who the process is for.

Methods can also be written to have a "template" of shared activity, but this
activity can be changed just a little bit when necessary. In the previous
lesson we saw a method called `say_hello_five_times`. But what if we wanted
to say "Hello" three times? Nine times? Twenty-two times? Our code would be
very cluttered if we had to write a separate method for each of those counts.

In this case we want the "template behavior" to be saying hello. But we want
to makt it possible to vary the number of times hello is said. The little
bit we want to change is the number of times.

The particular bits that make the change the way a method runs when it's 
called are called "arguments."

## Define a Method That Accepts Arguments

To define the ***arguments*** you expect a method to take, you specify ***parameters*** in the
line that starts with `def`. Be careful of the vocabulary here. Parameters
are the "catchers" to arguments. When you ***call*** a method the data you
pass in the ***call*** is called an argument. That passed data is given
a "local" name called a ***parameter***. You can access the data that 
was held in the ***argument*** by working with the ***parameter***.

If you're unclear on the difference betweeen argument and parameter, 
we'll clarify it here. Just keep in mind that while they point to
the same data, they ***are not the same thing***.

For example, if we want to write a method called `say_hello_multiple_times` that
accepts an argument of a person's name, we would do it like this:

```ruby
    #method name             #parameter
def say_hello_multiple_times(count)
  count.times do
    puts "Hello!"
  end
end
say_hello_multiple_times(3)
say_hello_multiple_times(2)
```

As you can see in the example above, the `count` parameter now holds a count, which
is being passed in as an argument in `say_hello_multiple_times`'s invocation.

Now that you've seen some code using arguments and parameters, let's repeat
our explanation of the difference between the two to make sure you've got it.

Arguments that are passed into methods create new _local_ variables that can be
used within the _scope_ of the method. We call these local variables _parameters_.
When you name an argument, you are defining what word you want to use to access
that data, just like when you create a variable. Arguments follow the same rules
as local variables: they can be any word that starts with a lowercase letter and
they should be as descriptive of the data as possible.

Let's open up IRB and try this out! First, take the `say_hello_multiple_times` code
sample and paste it into your command line. Once that has been entered, you can
test out the method like this:

```bash
say_hello_multiple_times(2)
```

A method can have **multiple** parameters. It's common to have two to four, typically.

Let's make our method a little bit more personable by adding a name that we
want to say "Hello" to.


This same pattern works for passing in as many arguments as you want by adding a
comma (`,`) between each argument you want to pass in. Let's try creating a
method that accepts two arguments: a person's name and their programming
language of choice.

```ruby
  # method name      first_parameter, second_parameter
def greeting_programmer(name, language)
  puts "Hello, #{name}. We heard you are a great #{language} programmer."
end

greeting_programmer("Maria", "Ruby")
# > Hello, Maria. We heard you are a great Ruby programmer.

greeting_programmer("Steven", "Elixir")
# > Hello, Steven. We heard you are a great Elixir programmer.
```

Once you define arguments for a method, they become _required_ when you invoke
or call the method. What happens when you don't pass in the required argument?
When an argument with a value is not passed in, you get an `ArgumentError`.
Here's an example:

```ruby
def greeting(name)
  puts "Hello, #{name}!"
end

greeting # We call the method without a value for the argument `name`
# > ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (0 for 1)

greeting(name) # If we call the method without setting a value for name, or passing in a value for the argument `name` we see:
# > NameError: undefined local variable or method `name' for main:Object
```

The word, in this case `name`, that we use as a parameter in the method
signature becomes a local variable within the method. Through that variable, we
can reference the value of the argument inside the body of the method.

The number of arguments, or inputs, an operation expects is called _arity_. The
_arity_ of addition is two: we expect two numbers to add. The `arity` of
`greeting` is one: we told Ruby to expect one argument for its parameter, `name`
and by golly, Ruby won't be able to make the code work if we break our promise.

A method defined to accept one argument will raise an error if
called with more than one argument.

```ruby
def greeting(name)
  puts "Hello, #{name}!"
end

greeting("Maria", "Ruby") # The method accepts 1 argument and I supplied 2.
# > ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (2 for 1)
```

Again, the arity of greeting is one; if two arguments are provided, we'll see an
error. By default, all arguments defined in a method are required to correctly
invoke (or "call", or "execute") that method and method arguments create local
variables for you use when the method is actually called.

## Recognize the Difference Between Arguments and Parameters

Now that we know how to define a method with arguments, let's define the
difference between _arguments_ and _parameters_, which are subtle, but important
to know when working with or discussing code.

A _parameter_ is a local variable, specific to the method that the method expects you to pass when you call it. Inside the method, the programming language will let you use that local variable name (the _parameter_) to "get" the value (_the argument_) that was assigned to it when you _called_ the method.

An _argument_ is the value you pass to a method when you call the method that is, in turn, assigned to a _parameter_.

In simpler words, parameters appear in method definitions; arguments appear in
method calls. For example:

```ruby
def greeting(parameter)
  puts "Hello, #{parameter}!"
end

greeting(argument)
```

In the `greeting` method, the variable `parameter` is the parameter for the
method and when calling the method, the value passed for `argument` is the
argument.

## Define a Method That Uses Default Arguments

Occasionally, we will need to write methods that behave a specific way _by
default_, but provide the flexibility to behave differently if we chose.

Take the previous `greeting` method exampleâ€”what if we wanted to say
hello to someone whose name we didn't know? If we run `greeting` without
passing in an argument?

```ruby
def greeting(name)
  puts "Hello, #{name}!"
end

greeting
# > ArgumentError (wrong number of arguments (given 0, expected 1))
```

We get an `ArgumentError` like we did when passing too many arguments.

Using a default argument we can provide a default value for `name` in
the event that no argument is provided. Default arguments are included
after the parameter name as seen below:

```ruby
def greeting(name = 'neighbor')
  puts "Hello, #{name}!"
end

greeting
# > Hello, neighbor!
```

Instead of getting an error above, the default argument is used and the method
runs normally. If we decide to pass in an argument, the method will use
that argument instead:

```ruby
greeting("Steven")
# > Hello, Steven!
```

Default arguments are often used when we're writing a method with multiple
parameters, some required, some optional. In the example below, we've
modified `greeting_programmer` so that the `name` method is required, but
the programming language is optional.

```ruby
  # method name      first_parameter, second_parameter
def greeting_programmer(name, language = "computer")
  puts "Hello, #{name}. We heard you are a great #{language} programmer."
end

greeting_programmer("Steven", "Ruby")
# > Hello, Steven. We heard you are a great Ruby programmer.

greeting_programmer("Maria")
# > Hello, Maria. We heard you are a great computer programmer.
```

## Conclusion

To create dynamic functions in Ruby, pass in arguments, which are
stored as _parameters_ within the scope of the method, that can be used in the
body of the method.

This gives us a lot more flexibility to maintain efficient codebases, as well
as to apply real-world concepts when building our programs. You'll learn more
about arguments in future lessons.
